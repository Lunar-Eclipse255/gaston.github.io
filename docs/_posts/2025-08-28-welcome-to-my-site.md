# Welcome to My New Website!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to finally have this up and running.

## What's New

I've just launched this site using:
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting
- **Minima theme** for a clean, professional look

## What's Coming

I plan to use this space to:
- Share my projects and experiences
- Write tutorials and guides
- Document my learning journey
- Connect with other developers

## Stay Tuned

More content is coming soon! Feel free to check back regularly or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lunar-Eclipse255).

Thanks for visiting! ðŸŽ‰
