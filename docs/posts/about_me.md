My name is Gaston Grehan-Savona. I was born in Hartford, Connecticut in the year 2008 and I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida when I was seven years old. I enrolled in Shorecrest in the 2020-2021 school year. I was a member of the Shorecrest competitive First Lego League team for two years, both of those years we went to the state competition. I won multiple awards in FLL such as in my second year I won robot design awards at the qualifying, regional, and state tournaments. I continued robotics in high school competing in vex for four years. Qualifying for multiple International tournaments, winning an international programming award, and winning our state championship. I am half American and half French, visiting my grandparents in Provence, in the south of France, often during the summer.
