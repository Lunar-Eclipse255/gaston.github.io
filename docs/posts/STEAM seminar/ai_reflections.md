### Definition: What is your personal definition of Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a trained algorithm with the ability to have dynamic weights and priorities in order to solve a problem, in contrast to algorithms with static weights. Meaning that the AI uses multiple different weights in order to determine an ouput. With the AI being able to change their weights, in turn changing the priorities of certain factors. The weighing of the different weights is done through training (whether it be supervised, unsepervised or reinforcement learning). As opposed to a simpler algorithm in which these weights anre static, and pre-inputted so that the algorithm has a predetermined priority of factors to get an output.

### Technological Impact and Personal Connection: Identify a specific AI application or tool that you interact with or observe daily. How has your understanding of the underlying technology changed your perspective on this interaction?
The AI tool that I would say that I use most often would be a LLM Chatbot such as ChatGPT. My understanding of the underlying technology changed my perspective, because at first I thought of ChatGPT as having the ability for more intelligent and independent thought. Then I learned how it actually works, I already understood that it used multiple layers of nodes/neurons in order to give a response, but what I didn't know that it's output worked like a fancy autocorrect, in which after asked a question it would repsond by finding the most likely next word and then work consecutivly from there. The independent thought in which it was able to give slightly different responses to the same prompt was from temperature (randomness) in which there is a chance, in order to add variety, that the chatbot won't use the most likely next word but will use the 2nd, or 3rd, word (or longer down). 

### Bias and Equity in Model Training: You've learned about how data can introduce bias into AI models. Describe a real-world scenario where a biased AI model could negatively impact a specific group of people. What steps could the developers take in the training data or model evaluation phase to mitigate this unfairness?
A real world situation in which a biased AI model could negatively impact a specific group of people would be with facial recognition. Many facial recognition models don't have as large of an amount of non-white faces as they do white faces. This leads to these facial recognition softwares misidentifying non-white people. Negative consequences arriving from this would be a non-white perosn being confused fro a criminal and being arrested because of this misidentification. To mitigate this issue, when in training the developer could use a wider more diverse array of faces. 

### Ethical Responsibility and Decision-Making: If you were an AI developer, what ethical principle or concern would be your absolute top priority, and why? How would this priority influence the design or deployment choices you'd make for a new AI product?


### Environmental Cost and Sustainability: Discuss the environmental concerns associated with AI. Propose one practical idea or policy that could help make the development and use of large-scale AI more sustainable:

### Future Role and Regulation: Based on your learning, what do you believe is the single most important action (e.g., a law, an educational change, or a technological safeguard) that society should take right now to prepare for or safely manage the increasing integration of AI into everyday life? Explain your reasoning:
I belive the single most important action to prepare for the increasing integration of AI, is educational change. In which schools would educate students on the use and issues of AI. In which they would not bar the use of AI fully but educate on how to properly use it as a tool, as well as educate them on how to ethically and responsibly use AI. Education can also lead to a greater understanding on how AI works, so that future lawmakers, having a better understanding when trying to make regulation regarding AI. Lastly, teaching on the issues with AI will help people have a greater understanding on it's impact as well as how the models can be sometimes biased and untruthful. 

### AI in Industry: Write a brief introduction about the AI Industry flyer assignment in your own words. What were you asked to do? Then include a screenshot of your final poster:
