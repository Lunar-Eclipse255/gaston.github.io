### Progress Overview:
What I've been able to tackle in the past three weeks, was the full coding of the Monte Carlo Localization code. Including both the main loop and the raycasting. I was also able to tune the sensors and start to work on the noise. Lastly I have also worked on the introduction pages to my paper. I am most proud ofgetting the Monte carlo Localization code to work on a physical robot.

### Experts & Mentors: 
Discuss the individuals who have influenced or helped your work to date. List who has helped and why. Discuss how their advice, feedback, or resources change the direction of your project?

 

### Roadblocks & Resolutions: 
Projects rarely go exactly as planned. Identify the "potholes" you've hit. What is currently slowing you down or causing concern? Propose at least two ideas for how you might resolve these issues. What’s your "Plan B"?

 

### Reflection: 
How are you doing? Take a moment to check in with yourself. These prompts are here to help think critically about your progress and work habits. Your responses don't have to be long—just 2–3 honest sentences for each is fine. This section is meant to encourage you to think deeply about how you are working, not just what you are producing.

 

    How are you feeling about your progress? Why? [Energized? Excited? Overwhelmed? Worried?]
    Are your time-managment habits working? Is your current "way of working" sustainable for the rest of the school year? Are you using class time wisely to work on your project?
    Identify one moment in the last three weeks when you felt most productive or "in the zone." What were you doing, and what was your environment like? How can you recreate this environment?
    Do you believe you have made adequate progress [met all of the goals you have set, staying on track, making continuous improvement] these first few weeks.
