## Literature Review: Making Advanced Mathematics and Computer Science Topics Accessible to High School Students  

&nbsp; &nbsp; As technologies pushed forward by computer science and mathematics play a more important role in society, students’ abilities to interact with these concepts become more and more important. The purpose of this literature review is to address the research question of how advanced mathematics and computer science concepts (like probabilistic algorithms) can be made more accessible and easier for high school students to understand. The purpose of this review is to examine existing research and sources on the challenges of teaching advanced computer science and mathematics at the high school level, inequalities in access to advanced coursework, and pedagogical approaches shown to improve accessibility: in order to identify gaps in the current sources. 

#### Barriers of Jargon
&nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced mathematics and computer science often become inaccessible to high school students because the instruction usually assumes prior mathematical knowledge of standards, and not because of the inherent complexity. These topics often introduce unnecessary jargon and abstraction, in ways that exceed students’ preexisting conceptual frameworks. Research on teaching mathematics within computer science demonstrates how formal mathematical notation and theory can be a barrier to students when they are taught content without context or connection (Neri, 2021). Neri (2021) argues that students with programming experience struggle when mathematical content is taught in a purely abstract way, leading to lessened engagement and disinterest in advanced computer science topics. Similarly, studies examining high school computer science courses suggest that an overemphasis on the syntax in programming limits students’ ability to think about complex systems and programs. As opposed to teaching about  underlying algorithmic and conceptual understanding. (Bell et al., 2014; González et al., 2019). Bell et al. outlines that when schools focus on syntax, it leads to students being able to write code, but without the mathematical or logical reasons behind the code. This limits the students ability to apply this knowledge to other unfamiliar use cases or to reason about why an algorithm works, rather than just how to implement the algorithm (2014). However, evidence from other high abstraction topics illustrates how the barriers still aren’t fixed. An article from Sun et al. (2024) demonstrates that it is possible to lower those barriers by starting with classical concepts familiar to the students, and progressing towards more formal and abstract representations of topics. When this approach to teaching advanced mathematics and computer science is followed, this has been proven to lower levels of intimidation and leads to a greater conceptual understanding (Sun et al., 2024). Altogether, these findings suggest that the main challenge in teaching advanced mathematics and computer science is not in the student’s ability to learn complex ideas, but instead in the instructional approaches that introduce jargon and abstraction before the students have developed the proper base. 

#### Inequities in Course Offerings
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inequities in access to advanced mathematics and computer science coursework significantly affect which students are able to engage with higher-level concepts, which makes accessibility a structural issue rather than just instructional. National research shows that high schools that serve larger proportions of students from lower-income backgrounds and students of color, are less likely to offer advanced mathematics courses, including Calculus, Physics, and advanced statistics. This research was backed by both the articles from Leung-Gagné et al. (2021) and Wolfe et al. (2023). With both articles correlating access to advanced mathematics and computer science in schools to lower socioeconomic areas. While, Leung-Gagné et al. additionally highlight that this lack of access leads to lower college readiness and a gap in opportunities among historically underrepresented students. The two studies come together in identifying how the disparities are not just limited to course offerings but also extend, to differences in instructional quality, resources, and rigor across schools. Furthermore, inequitable access to advanced coursework often starts before high school, with articles mentioning that unequal access to Algebra I in middle school acts as an early gatekeeper for students's access to advanced mathematics pathways later on. (Wolfe et al., 2023; Leung-Gagné et al., 2021). As a result, students in under-resourced schools are less likely to have the content needed for advanced computer science and mathematics concepts. Even when advanced concepts are offered, gaps still exist at the course level. This is because teachers in lower-income schools are more likely to skip content or replace it with content from previous grade levels, due to time constraints, or insufficient support. (Wolfe et al., 2023). With this issue compounding over time and underpreparing them for advanced learning opportunities. Taken together, these findings illustrate how inequities in advanced mathematics and computer science education come from differences in course availability, curriculum rigor, and instructional conditions, which highlight that improving accessibility means addressing both pedagogical and structural barriers.

#### Methods to Increase Approachability and Accessibility
&nbsp; &nbsp; Research on pedagogy suggests that approachability and accessibility in advanced mathematics and computer science improve when the teaching is designed around supporting diverse students, through scaffolding, multiple representations of concepts, and explicit connections between the abstract and its real-world applications. In Salgarayeva & Makhanova’s How People Learn II: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures (2018), they come up with a central framework called Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which emphasizes the importance of giving multiple ways of representation, engagement, and expression, in order to reduce barriers before the teaching even begins. In studies that apply the UDL principles in computer science classrooms, it is illustrated that when students are given a variety of ways to interact with the content, those students show great improvement in engagement and programming skills. Similarly, research highlights the importance of gradual, scaffolded, progression. In which students progress from familiar concepts towards more formal and abstract ideas. The models that begin with a foundational base, and gradually introduce more complex representations have been shown to reduce intimidation and complexity, especially in mathematically intense topics. (Sun et al., 2024; 2018). This approach is useful because it improves teaching by connecting prior knowledge to new information rather than introducing it in isolation. In addition, several studies emphasize the role of computational thinking and contextualized learning as pedagogical tools in order to improve accessibility in learning. By combining algorithmic reasoning and hands-on activities in mathematics and computer science, it improves students’ motivation, and understanding, even in lower-resource environments. (Bell et al., 2014; Mumcu et al., 2023). However, while these studies demonstrate how these approaches improve engagement, they also highlight that the connection to formal and abstract concepts should not come at the expense of rigor. All in all, these pedagogical approaches underline the importance of improving approachability to advanced mathematics and computer science topics through teaching design, that emphasizes conceptual depth, through scaffolding, representation, and connection to real-world application. 
	
&nbsp; &nbsp; The literature reviewed illustrates that accessibility in advanced mathematics and computer science is influenced by instructional design, structural inequalities, and pedagogical approaches. Studies that evaluate instructional challenges highlight that students struggle when introduced to advanced concepts through formal abstraction without a conceptual base. At the same time, research in inequities demonstrates that systemic factors shape which students are able to engage with advanced concepts. Altogether, the literature suggests that a pedagogical approach grounded in real-world applications can reduce mental barriers and improve engagement. Despite agreement on the importance of accessibility and equality, a gap remains in how advanced mathematical and computer science foundations are translated into forms that align with high school students’ desire to learn content outside of their courses, while maintaining conceptual rigor. Existing research tends to focus on structural access or broad pedagogical frameworks, with not much attention to the design of student materials, to bridge mathematical reasoning and computational implementation. As a result, there is not enough guidance on how underlying advanced mathematics and computer science concepts, can be made accessible without oversimplification. 
	
&nbsp; &nbsp; Addressing this gap is a next step towards improving accessibility in STEAM education. By exploring how advanced mathematics and computer science concepts can be reframed to support conceptual understanding, we can enable a wider range of high school students to engage with more advanced content. With this responding to the guiding research question of how advanced mathematics and computer science concepts can be made more accessible and easier for high school students to understand.
