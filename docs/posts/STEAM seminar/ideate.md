### Introduction: 
This part is the ideation phase in which I will start by coming up with a variety of ideas to solve my problem Statement, then ending with just one idea. This phase is important because it allows me to throw down a bunch of ideas no matter how feasible they are then be able to pick just one. For my ideation phase my problem statement was: "How can I make advanced math and computer science concepts (like probabilistic algorithms) more accessible and easier for high school students to understand?"

### The Brainstorming Process:
I generated my ideas by taking 20 minutes to write down any idea on Figjam that I could think of. My mindset wasn't to think of what was possible and instead I was just thinking of what could solve the problem.

### Narrowing the Focus:
I moved from many ideas to one idea by first choosing my three favorite ideas. Then I used a selection matrix to narrow it down to one idea. The matrix had 5 criteria all out of five, and with the criteria being, Impact, Feasibility, Innovation, SDG Alignment, and STEAM Alignment. After that I created a persona to better understand the person who would use my final solution. I also created a project stoy and layed out a blueprint for my future work.
