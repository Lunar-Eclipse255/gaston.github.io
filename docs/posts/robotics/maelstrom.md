## Personal Project Intro

 ### Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the Personal Project is so that we can solve an issue in the real world. While also using skills and our expertise in the STEAM field we are pursuing. The skills we are developing are in research, application, and problem solving with the goal of solving a real world problem related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

### Problem Statement:
My problem statement is: How can I make advanced math and computer science concepts (like probabilistic algorithms) more accessible and easier for high school students to understand? This is an issue currently because many papers and websites outside of the core curriculum/units are either paid or jargon-heavy. This problem needs to be fixed because it will allow students to learn and discover outside of the classes more easily, encouraging them to learn.

### UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
The UN SDG I am working around is SDG 4: Quality Education. By solving my problem statement, it will contribute to this SDG because it will allow students to further their education outside of school and class. This encourages the pursuit of knowledge and allows students to have a more robust and quality education.

### Why is the Topic Important to Me:
This topic relates to me because of my involvement in robotics. This is because in robotics you are encouraged to explore outside of the core curriculum in order to solve problems. I have noticed an issue that with particularly advanced topics (that are largely beneficial), many students aren't able to learn because they are unfamiliar with the mathematical jargon and are therefore left out. This motivates me because when I discovered this with a concept called Monte-Carlo Localization, I noticed many other competitors were unable to use it because they couldn't understand the jargon the papers used. It's not that they couldn't understand it. It's just the fact that the papers used jargon rather than explanations.

### Development of Project Idea:
How we developed the project idea is we first wrote out interests, hobbies, skills, strengths, passions, and questions. We then used our answers to these to find out which SDG we connected with the most, and then narrowed it down to one SDG, number 4: Quality Education. We then brainstormed three school/personal problems, three local/community problems, and three global/systematic problems. We then narrowed it down to three problems we connected with. Then we narrowed it to one problem we connected with. Then we used Root Cause Analysis on the problem in order to discover the fundamental causes of the problem. After that we mapped out the problem with a web, asking the questions of who, where, when, and what, as well as finding the effects, causes, and current solutions to their issues.
