    I decided to take a Python class now because over the summer of 2022 I took a summer class on Java at the University of South Florida in Tampa. I enjoyed it and wanted to continue to learn about programming. During my freshmen year in high school I joined the VEX robotics team and as the programmer I have to be proficient in Python because that is one of the major sources of code for programming the robot.
