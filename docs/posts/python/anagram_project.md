# The Project: 
The goal of the project was to get a user inputted word and find all the words that are an anagram of that word from the dictionary.

# The Explanation: 
The code creates a list to hold all the words that are anagrams of the user inputted word and a counter is defined and set as 0. The code uses a for loop to go through all the words in a list that have the same length as the user word.  It also goes through all the letters in the first word in the list and copare it to all letters in the user word. The word will only be appended if all the letters match.

# The Challenge: 
What I found challenging in the project were keeping track of nested loops and statements and which loops activated when.

# Challenges and Successes of Working with a Partner: 
The succeses of working with a partner is that we are able to complete the code in half the time but a challenge is that if one partner finishes earlier than other that partner has nothing to do.

# Change: 
What I would do differently if I re-did the project is that I would keep it simple and not over complicate it at the beginning. 

# Application: 
The project helped me apply most things we have done this year and compile them together into one project allowing me to be able to see their practical application more.
