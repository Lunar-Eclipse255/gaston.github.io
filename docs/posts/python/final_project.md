For the final project, we had to make a game using what we learned throughout the year. I originally chose a farming related game, getting the basis, main structure and sub functions down but struggling to bring them together due to limitations in pygame. I then started again rebuilding a lot of these functions, but with no avail, so I scrapped the idea for a platformer. Furthermore, I wanted to focus on the atmosphere and cohesion because I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to work on special mechanics. I wanted it to be difficult but rewarding. Due to time limitations, I was only able to do one level. Below is a video of the code and of gameplay. 


### Reflection:
Here were some reflection questions we were given and my responses:
What is one thing you’d suggest that you think would improve your game?
I would improve my collisions, so the game is more accurate and looks better.

What did you learn about game design from making your game?
I learned animations, better time management, not biting off more than you can chew, and don’t try to learn a lot of new stuff for a final project when you are really busy.

What is your favorite part/element of your game?
The sprites and character work/ the atmosphere.

What do you feel is the biggest challenge or limitation of Pygame?  
Speed and/or processing power

What parts of Pygame do you still not clearly understand and wish you had learned more about?
Collisions and working with classes with more complexity. 

What is the favorite game you have made this semester and why?
Pong, it worked well and had a clean aesthetic.
